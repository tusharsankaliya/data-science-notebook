# Arithmetic Expression Examples

In this section, we will explore some basic arithmetic expressions used in programming. These expressions perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### Example Arithmetic Expressions:
1. **Addition**: `5 + 3`  →  Results in `8`
2. **Subtraction**: `10 - 4` →  Results in `6`
3. **Multiplication**: `7 * 2` →  Results in `14`
4. **Division**: `20 / 4` →  Results in `5.0`
5. **Exponentiation**: `2 ** 3` →  Results in `8`
6. **Modulus**: `10 % 3` →  Results in `1` (remainder of division)
7. **Floor Division**: `9 // 4` →  Results in `2` (quotient of division)







# Define two numbers
num1 = 5
num2 = 3

# Multiply the numbers
product = num1 * num2

# Add the numbers
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Display the results
print("Product of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", product)
print("Sum of", num1, "and", num2, "is:", sum_result)


# Define the number of minutes
minutes = 150

# Convert minutes to hours
hours = minutes / 60

# Display the result
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours} hours.")




# Objectives

- Understand the basic arithmetic operations in Python.
- Learn how to perform conversions between units, such as minutes to hours.
- Familiarize with using code cells in Jupyter notebooks for performing computations.
- Explore data science tools and libraries that aid in analysis and visualization.
- Practice creating markdown cells for documentation and code explanation.
